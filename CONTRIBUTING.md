# Contributing to Google Maps Navigation Flutter Plugins

_See also: [Flutter's code of conduct](https://flutter.io/design-principles/#code-of-conduct)_

## 1. Essential Setup for Contributors

- **Operating System:** Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- **Version Control:** [git](https://git-scm.com).
- **Development Environment:** An IDE such as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Code Formatting:** [`swiftformat`](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat) (available via brew on macOS, on Windows install Swift toolchain and build SwiftFormat from git sources). 

### 1.1. Installing swiftformat
The CI is locked to swiftformat 0.53 version which you can install with the command below:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/86f85aaa82beba49f8a5aabf3a22508c9249f188/Formula/s/swiftformat.rb
brew install swiftformat.rb
```

## 2. Setting Up Your Local Repository

- **Preparation:** Before starting, make sure you have all dependencies installed as mentioned in the prior section.
- **Fork the Repository:** Navigate to `https://github.com/googlemaps/flutter-navigation-sdk` and create a fork in your GitHub account.
- **SSH Key Configuration:** If your machine doesn't have an SSH key registered with GitHub, generate one following the instructions at [Generating SSH Keys on GitHub.](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).
- **Clone Your Fork:** Use the command `git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/google_maps_flutter_navigation.git` to clone the repository to your local machine.
- **Add remote upstream:** Establish a link to the main repository for updates using command `git remote add upstream git@github.com:googlemaps/flutter-navigation-sdk.git` This ensures you pull changes from the original source, not just your clone, when using git fetch and similar commands.

## 3. Install Melos

This project leverages [Melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos) to manage the project and its dependencies.

Run the following command to install Melos:

```bash
dart pub global activate melos
```

## 4. Automatically generated MethodChannel with Pigeon

### Using pigeon

Google Maps Navigation Flutter Plugins utilizes [pigeon](https://github.com/flutter/packages/tree/main/packages/pigeon) to generate the `MethodChannel` API layer between Dart and the native platforms.
To modify the messages sent with Pigeon (i.e., the API code between Dart and native platforms), you can edit the `pigeons/messages.dart` file in the corresponding folder and regenerate the code by running the following melos command:

```
melos run generate:pigeon
```

Remember to format the generated files using the formatter.

> [!NOTE]
> The melos script automatically runs the formatter after pigeon generation.

### Testing pigeon generated code

To test the created interface, you can mock the interface directly with:

```dart
late MockTestNAMEHostApi mockApi;
TestNAMEHostApi.setup(mockApi);
```

Add a unit test to a new method:

1. Mock the return value (if the function has one).

```dart
when(mockApi.newMethod(any)).thenReturn(returnValueIn);
```

3. Call the public API.

```dart
returnValueOut = await GoogleMapsNavigationPlatform.instance.newMethod(parameterIn)
```

4. Check that the parameters and return values passed between the public API and platform match.

```dart
final VerificationResult result = verify(mockApi.newMethod(captureAny));
final MyType parameterOut = result.captured[0] as MyType;
expect(parameterIn.param, parameterOut.param)
expect(returnValueIn.param, returnValueOut.param)
```

See examples in `test/` folders.

## 5. Running the Navigation Example

The Google Maps Flutter Navigation plugin provides an example app that showcases its main use-cases.

To run the Navigation example, navigate to the `example` directory of the plugin and run the app:

```bash
cd example
flutter run --dart-define MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## 6. Running tests

Google Maps Flutter Navigation package has integration and unit tests. 

### Unit tests

To run unit tests for the Google Maps Flutter Navigation plugin, navigate to the plugin's root directory and execute the `flutter test` command. Use the following command:

```bash
melos run test:dart
```

To run unit tests on Android call

```bash
melos run test:android
```

To run unit tests on iOS, follow these steps:
1. Open Xcode.
2. Navigate to the Test Navigator.
3. Find and select the "RunnerTests" target.
4. Click on the play icon button to run the tests.

Or to run the iOS unit tests from command line, call

```bash
DEVICE='iPhone 15' melos run ios:test
```

Specify the device you want to run the tests on with the DEVICE env variable. 

### Integration tests

Integration tests are responsible for ensuring that the plugin works against the native Navigation SDK for both Android and iOS platforms. Patrol is used for the integration tests to simplify interactions with native elements. To use patrol, you first need to activate the patrol_cli.  

```bash
flutter pub global activate patrol_cli 3.2.0
```

To ensure that all necessary dependencies for patrol are properly set up, run the following command:

```bash
patrol doctor
```

Google Maps Flutter Navigation integration tests can be run with the following command:

```bash
cd ./example
patrol test --dart-define MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

To only run a specific test file, use patrol command with -t flag. For example to run a navigation_test.dart run it with the following command:

```bash
cd ./example
patrol test --dart-define MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY -t integration_test/navigation_test.dart
```

Test report should appear in the build folder:

```
Android - example/build/app/reports/androidTests/connected/debug/index.html
iOS - example/build/ios_results_*.xcresult
```

When adding new tests, add the location dialog and ToS check to the beginning of each test.

```dart
    await checkLocationDialogAndTosAcceptance($);
```

For debugging the tests, you can add `debugPrint()` functions in your test and use patrol develop mode with the `--verbose` flag to see the printed messages. To run `navigation_test.dart` in develop mode, use the following command:

```bash
cd ./example
patrol develop --dart-define MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY --verbose -t integration_test/navigation_test.dart
```

Please note that the "hot restart" feature in patrol's develop mode may not work correctly with all test files.

#### Android emulator setup

If the patrol tests fail to run on the Android emulator due to insufficient RAM, increase the emulator's default RAM allocation to ensure proper test execution.

## 7. Contributing code

We welcome contributions through GitHub pull requests.

Before working on any significant changes, please review the [Flutter style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo) and [design principles](https://flutter.io/design-principles/). These guidelines help maintain code consistency and avoid common pitfalls.

To begin working on a patch, follow these steps:

1. Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository:
